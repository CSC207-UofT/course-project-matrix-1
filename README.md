# Phase 0 instructions
## Cloning/running our skeleton code
1. Clone this repository, enter the `main` branch
2. Open the `Phase0` directory, set `src` as sources root, `test` as test sources root
3. Open + run `UserInterface`
## Other Phase 0 requirements
* All our other files are PDFs under the `Phase0` directory
### CRC cards notes
* These cards (aside from the UserInterface) are split into two distinct groups by a line: those on the left are equation generation methods, those on the right are user related methods
### Specification notes
* In this document we've included a sample UI representation to make our specification easier to understand
### Walkthrough
* This walkthrough models our CRC cards rather than our skeleton code, as stated on Quercus
  * Like the cards, we have split the walkthrough into two sections
* However, most features have been implemented at a basic level and are similar to our walkthrough
